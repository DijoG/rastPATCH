\title{Fast raster tiling using Python's rasterio with overlap}
\usage{
TILES(input_path, output_dir, tile_size = 2000, overlap = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_path}{Path to input raster file (GeoTIFF)}

\item{output_dir}{Directory where tiles will be saved (creates "tiles" subdirectory)}

\item{tile_size}{Size of output tiles in pixels (default: 2000)}

\item{overlap}{Size of overlap (pixels) between tiles (default: 20)}
}
\value{
Geotiff tiles in the automatically created 'tiles' tiles directory (invisibly), plus path string
}
\description{
This function leverages a Python backend (`raster_tile.py`) to split large rasters
into smaller, overlapping tiles for efficient processing.
